# EXOPLANET HUNTING

Using light fluctiation data from NASA's Kepler telescope four different models were trained to differentiate exoplanets from non-exoplanets. running demo.py you can compare the four different classification rates.

# Dependencies
run python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
To run the program you need to install the following with pip: 
tensorflow,
keras,
sklearn, 
numpy, 
scipy, 
pandas, 
matplotlib, 
imblearn, 
Counter

from there any of the files can be run to see sample outputs. 

# Files

- demo.py: file will allow you interact with the models and predict individual planets. 

- driver.py: file will allow you to load and save models. 

# Data set

data can be found from Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data/downloads/kepler-labelled-time-series-data.zip
